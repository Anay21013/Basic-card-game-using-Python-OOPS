# Basic-card-game-using-Python-OOPS
This is a basic game that is based on random card distribution amongst two players and utilizes Object Oriented Programming in Python.
The program implements the famous card game - "WAR" in which the player with higher face value sum cards wins and war is declared if the face value of the cards held by the two players is the same.

P.S :- this game does not have any sort of graphics and is just to understand the basics of OOPS in Python.
